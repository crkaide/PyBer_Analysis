# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this report is to provide follow-up analysis to my employer, PyBer, regarding ride-sharing data presented to CEO V. Isualize.  Information already presented includes scatter-plot visualization of city types, fares, and rides; high-level statistics summaries (both tables and box-and-whisker plots); and share by city type of fares and drivers.

Following the initial presentation, the CEO requested a written report addressing data represented on a line graph of weekly fares by city type.

Although the initial analysis was thorough, the presentation did not address any of the data from a longitudinal perspective, and recommendations were not therefore informed by trends.  This follow-up addendum closes that gap
